parties</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruuvi</li>
<li>Your organization's applications</li>
<li>A device</li>
<li>The customer</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/four-involved-parties.png" alt="four involved authentication parties"></p>
<p class="caption">Each of the four parties plays a critical role in how
your product will function</p>

<p>Understanding how all four interact, manage data, and  secure information is critical to launching a successful product on the Ruuvi platform.
Specifically, this section of the guide will go deep into decisions you
must make on authentication and security with regards to your product.
The results of these decisions will impact where and how data is
stored as well as the ways in which your organization's applications
interact with Ruuvi to control devices and manage customers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Many of the implementation details discussed in this document are still under development. We will add specific code examples and context as they become available in the mobile and JavaScript SDKs.</em></p>
<h2 id="#oauth" data-href="oauth-I2Ar">OAuth<a href="#oauth" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="oauth-I2Ar"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h2><p>Ruuvi tightly adheres to OAuth specifications to ensure secure and
correct access to private data and devices. OAuth is an open standard
for authorization, providing client applications "secure delegated
access" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Integral to OAuth is the concept of <em>clients</em>, and <em>client credentials</em>.
An OAuth client generally represents an application, like a native iOS
application running on an iPhone or a web app running in a browser. As
part of the setup process for your product, you will need to create one or more
OAuth clients for your organization.</p>
<p>Your organization's OAuth client will be needed when hitting the
Ruuvi API to perform actions that only your organization's team
members or applications should be able to perform. An example of this is
creating a customer that belongs to your organization via the Ruuvi
API. Only those with a valid OAuth client will be able to perform this
action, protecting your organization from fake or erroneous new customer
accounts.</p>
<p><em>Client credentials</em> are comprised of two pieces of information: A
<strong>client ID</strong>, and a <strong>secret</strong>. Passing these two pieces of data to
the Ruuvi API will allow you to create <strong>access tokens</strong>, which are
described in detail in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="#scopes" data-href="scopes-jh0r">Scopes<a href="#scopes" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="scopes-jh0r"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h3><p>Scopes allow you to specify exactly what type of access the client (and
tokens created using the client) should have. Scopes are used for
security reasons to limit the allowed applications of OAuth client
credentials. Depending on which authentication method you choose, you
may need to specify a scope when creating your OAuth client. <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3">More on
scopes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="#creating-an-oauth-client" data-href="creating-an-oauth-client-oTUw">Creating an OAuth Client<a href="#creating-an-oauth-client" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="creating-an-oauth-client-oTUw"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h3><p>Soon (Late August 2015) you will be able to go to the
<a href="https://dashboard.ruuvi.io/">Ruuvi dashboard</a> and click
“Create app” to create a client ID and secret.
(Ping @zachary in the <a href="http://community.ruuvi.io/">forum</a>
if we fall behind on this estimate or you just want to say how much
you want this feature!)</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/create-oauth-client.png" alt="Create OAuth Client"></p>
<p class="caption">Use the dashboard to create your OAuth client
credentials</p>

<p>Right now you can make an API call to create an create an OAuth client using the
instructions in our <a href="/reference/api/#create-an-oauth-client">API reference</a>
Your web app will use the generated client ID and secret  when you hit the
Ruuvi API on behalf of your organization and your customers to manage all the
devices in your product fleet.</p>
<p>In the API reference, note how there is an optional parameter called
<code>organization</code>. In order to create client credentials for your
organization, you should pass the <strong>slug</strong> of your organization as this
parameter. The easiest way to find the slug of your organization is in
the URL address when viewing your organization's dashboard, just after
the <code>/</code> in <code>dashboard.ruuvi.io/</code>. Example:
<code>dashboard.ruuvi.io/my-org</code>, where <code>my-org</code> is the organization slug.
The API request to create client credentials scoped to your organization
will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234" -d name=MyApp -d type=installed \
-d organization=my-org \
https://api.ruuvi.io/v1/clients
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>type</code> of the OAuth client will depend on your authentication method
and application medium (web or mobile). More on this
<a href="#choosing-an-authentication-method">later</a>.</p>
<p>There is also an optional <code>scope</code> parameter, which can be set to
<code>create_customer</code>. This option will scope the client to only be able
to create customers for your organization. Pass this parameter if you
are using <a href="#simple-authentication">simple authentication</a>.</p>
<p>If successful, the API will return your client ID and secret in the
response to the request. <strong>Never expose your client credentials,
especially if they are unscoped</strong>. Credentials are sensitive pieces of
information that, if exposed, could allow unauthorized people or
applications to interact with your organization's data and devices. <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2">More
on registering clients</a>.</p>
<h2 id="#access-tokens" data-href="access-tokens-iwyn">Access Tokens<a href="#access-tokens" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="access-tokens-iwyn"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h2><p>A related concept to understand is how Ruuvi uses access
tokens for authentication and security. If you have ever logged into the
Web IDE, called a function on a Ruuvi device, or read a variable via
the API, you are already using access tokens! It is important to note
that OAuth credentials are needed to create access tokens.</p>
<h3 id="#what-39-s-an-access-token-" data-href="what-39-s-an-access-token--6NEG">What's an access token?<a href="#what-39-s-an-access-token-" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="what-39-s-an-access-token--6NEG"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h3><p>An <em>access token</em> is a special code that is tied to a Ruuvi customer
or user, that allows reading data from and sending commands to that
person's device(s). Any API endpoint that returns private information,
or allows control of an individual's device requires an access token.
Tokens <em>inherit scopes</em> from the OAuth clients used to create them, and
can have more specific scopes of their own. <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.4">More on access
tokens</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a specific example. Let's say that on one of your own personal
devices (with device ID <code>0123456789abcdef01234567</code>), you want to call the <code>lightsOn</code> function. Here is how you would
do this using the API:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234" \
https://api.ruuvi.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/lightsOn \
-d arg=livingRoom
</code></pre>
<p>In order for the API to call the function on your device, you <em>must</em>
include a valid access token for the user that is the owner of the
device. In this case, you include your access token of <code>1234</code>. Behind
the scenes, the API looks up the access token in our database, checks to
make sure that the user who created the access token is the owner of the
device included in the request, and will only continue if the token has
the proper permissions to call the function.</p>
<p>For security purposes, most access tokens will expire after 90 days. Certain access tokens can be specifically set to <em>never expire</em>, like the one you can find in the settings pane of <code>build.ruuvi.io</code>.</p>
<h3 id="#customer-access-tokens" data-href="customer-access-tokens-ByU5">Customer access tokens<a href="#customer-access-tokens" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="customer-access-tokens-ByU5"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h3><p>Similarly, <em>your customers</em> will have access tokens that provide
verification of ownership of a particular device. As a product creator,
you will be creating a web or mobile application for your customers to
use your product. As part of your application, you will generate access
tokens on behalf of your customers, and use these access tokens to make
the desired calls to the Ruuvi API to successfully read data from and
control that customer's device.</p>

<p>Luckily, the mobile SDKs and RuuviJS will expose helper methods to
handle token creation and management, without much/any additional code

We've covered a lot so far and you're picking things up quick! This section will help you determine the best place for you to go next.</p>
<p>As described
<a href="/guide/how-to-build-a-product/dashboard/#organizations-vs-individuals">earlier</a>,
end-users of your product are referred to as <em>customers</em> in the Ruuvi
ecosystem. As a product creator, you will need to make a strategic decision
about how you will want to handle authentication for your customers. Your choice
will likely be influenced by how much you would like to hide Ruuvi from your
customers, as well as how you would like your product to function.</p>
<p>There are three ways to manage authentication for your customers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#simple-authentication"><strong>Simple Authentication</strong></a>: Customers are created and managed directly by Ruuvi. This is the simplest and fastest way to get your connected product app working.</li>
<li><a href="#two-legged-authentication"><strong>Two-legged Authentication</strong></a>: You create and manage accounts for your customers yourself, and request scoped access to control customers' devices from Ruuvi. This provides the maximum amount of flexibility and security for your application.</li>
<li><a href="#login-with-ruuvi"><strong>Login with Ruuvi</strong></a>: Your customers will create a Particle account and a separate account on your website, and link the two together using OAuth 2.0 <em>(Coming soon)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need to choose what <em>medium</em> your customers will use to
authenticate and setup their devices. This will likely depend on how you
envision your customers interacting with their connected product.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>: Use an iOS or Android mobile app to allow your customers to authenticate, setup their devices, and interact with their product. <a href="/guide/how-to-build-a-product/mobile-app/">More info</a></li>
<li><strong>Web</strong>: Use a web browser and HTTP to allow your customers to authenticate, setup their devices, and interact with their product (<em>Coming soon</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're ready, click on the authenticaiton method that makes most sense to you.</p>
<h2 id="#simple-authentication" data-href="simple-authentication-hTOS">Simple Authentication<a href="#simple-authentication" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="simple-authentication-hTOS"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h2><p>As the title suggests, Simple Authentication is the simplest and most straightforward to implement.
This is because in this method, your application will not have its own
server/back-end architecture. Instead, your web or mobile app will hit
the Ruuvi API directly for both session management and device
interactions. Below is a diagram communicating how simple authentication
works at a high level:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/simple-auth-high-level.png" alt="Simple authentication with Ruuvi"></p>
<p class="caption">Your application interacts directly with the Ruuvi
API using Simple Authentication</p>

<p>Let's take a simple example. Imagine you are the creator of a smart
lightbulb that can be controlled via a smartphone app. The <em>customer</em>,
or the end-user of the product, uses the mobile app to create an
account. Behind the scenes, your mobile app hits the Ruuvi API
directly to create a customer. Then the customer goes through the setup
process and links their device to their customer account. Again, your
mobile app uses the Ruuvi API to successfully claim the device to the customer
account. After the device is setup, the customer can toggle a light on
and off with the mobile app. This works as your app is able to call
functions on the customer's device using the customer's access token.</p>
<p>All of this is able to happen without the need to have your own server.
All communiation flows from the mobile client to the Ruuvi cloud,
then down to the customer's device.</p>
<h3 id="#advantages-of-simple-auth" data-href="advantages-of-simple-auth-fCpR">Advantages of Simple Auth<a href="#advantages-of-simple-auth" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="advantages-of-simple-auth-fCpR"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h3><p>Simple auth is ideal for getting a Ruuvi product up-and-running quickly. Without needing to build your own back-end, development time to
creating an app to work with a Ruuvi device is greatly reduced. There are less moving parts and opportunities to introduce bugs. In
addition, Ruuvi's <a href="/reference/ios/">mobile SDKs</a> and <a href="/reference/javascript/">JavaScript
SDK</a> will handle much of
the heavy lifting for you when it comes to session management and device
interaction. In short, simple auth is...simple.</p>
<p>Another advantage of simple authentication is the ability to hide
Ruuvi from your customers. The SDKs allow for <a href="/reference/ios/#customization">front-end skinning and
customization</a> that will allow you to
create your own brand experience for customers of your app. All
interaction with Ruuvi will happen behind the scenes, hidden from
your customers (unless they are tech savvy enough to monitor the network
traffic to and from your app).</p>
<h3 id="#disadvantages-of-simple-auth" data-href="disadvantages-of-simple-auth-Pv0l">Disadvantages of Simple Auth<a href="#disadvantages-of-simple-auth" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="disadvantages-of-simple-auth-Pv0l"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h3><p>Without your own server, you lose some level of flexibility and ability to customize in your application. For instance, if you wanted to
store custom information about your customer specific to your
application like their name or their favorite pizza topping, this would
not be currently supported with simple auth.</p>
<p>In addition, using simple auth would make it more difficult to capture
and use historical data about devices and customers' behavior. With your own
server and database, you could store data about what time a customer
turns on their lights, for example. Using simple auth, this would not be
supported.</p>
<h3 id="#simple-auth-implementation" data-href="simple-auth-implementation-grH0">Simple Auth Implementation<a href="#simple-auth-implementation" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="simple-auth-implementation-grH0"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h3><p>If you choose to go with simple authentication for your web or mobile
application, you should get to know the diagram below very well. While a
majority of the steps are wrapped by the mobile and JavaScript SDKs, it is still
important to grasp how customer authentication, device setup, and device
interaction work.</p>
<p>Each one of the steps will be covered in detail below. Note that the first two
steps are a one-time configuration process, whereas product setup will occur for
each new customer that sets up a device.</p>

<h4 id="#1-creating-oauth-client-credentials" data-href="1-creating-oauth-client-credentials-cOqn">1. Creating OAuth Client Credentials<a href="#1-creating-oauth-client-credentials" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="1-creating-oauth-client-credentials-cOqn"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h4><p>The first thing you will need to do is ensure that you have created proper OAuth
client credentials for your organization. In simple authentication,
communication will be direct from a client application (web or mobile app) to
the Ruuvi API. This is much less secure than server to server communication.
As a result, you will create <em>scoped</em> client credentials that will be able to do
one thing and one thing only: <strong>create new customers for your organization</strong>.</p>
<p>You will create your OAuth client using the Ruuvi dashboard <em>(Coming Soon)</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/creating-oauth-clients.png" alt="Creating OAuth Clients via the Ruuvi Dashboard"></p>
<p class="caption">You can use the Ruuvi Dashboard to create OAuth clients <em>(Coming Soon)</em></p>

<p>For now, you will need to use a cURL request to hit the API from your command
line to create the client. Creating OAuth clients was introduced
<a href="#creating-an-oauth-client">earlier</a>, but this section will give you specific
instructions on how to create clients specific for simple authentication.</p>
<p>If you are building a <strong>mobile app</strong> for your Ruuvi product, the cURL command to
create your client should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234" -d name=MyApp \
-d type=installed -d organization=my-org -d scope=create_customer \
https://api.ruuvi.io/v1/clients
</code></pre>
<p>Breaking this down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Authorization header includes <em>your Ruuvi user's</em> access token. This user must be a team member of the organization that you are creating the client for.</li>
<li><code>name</code> is the name of your OAuth client. Call this whatever you want, like SpunkyDonut!</li>
<li><code>type</code> should be set to <code>installed</code>. This means that this client is installed natively on a device like a mobile phone or tablet.</li>
<li><code>organization</code> should be set to your organization's <strong>slug</strong>. See <a href="#creating-an-oauth-client">above</a> for how to find your slug.</li>
<li><code>scope</code> <span class="red"><strong>MUST BE SET TO <code>create_customer</code></strong>! Omitting this scope is a serious security vulnerability for your product.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are building a <strong>web app</strong> instead, the cURL command will look different:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234" -d name=MyApp -d type=web \
-d redirect_uri=http://www.ruuvi.io/setup -d organization=my-org \
-d scope=create_customer https://api.ruuvi.io/v1/clients
</code></pre>
<p>Examining what's different, you'll find:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>type</code> is now set to <code>web</code>. This is because your client will be running in a web browser</li>
<li><code>redirect_uri</code> is now set as an argument. When creating a <code>web</code> client type, you must include a <code>redirect_uri</code>. This should be set to the URL of the first page of device setup for your product. The redirect will be triggered once a customer is created successfully, and the next step in the process is setting up their device.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/reference/api/#create-an-oauth-client">Reference documentation on creating OAuth
clients</a></p>
<p>With either request, you will receive an OAuth client ID and secret back in the response, like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "ok": true,
    "client": {
        "name": "MyApp",
        "type": [web or installed],
        "id": "myapp-2146",
        "secret": "615c620d647b6e1dab13bef1695c120b0293c342"
    }
}

Add OAuth Credentials to SDK<a href="#2-add-oauth-credentials-to-sdk" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="2-add-oauth-credentials-to-sdk-GcBh"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h4><p>For both the mobile &amp; JavaScript SDKs, you will need to add your client credentials to a configuration file. The client application will need the client credentials that you just generated when creating new customers. Without these credentials, calls to <code>POST /v1/orgs/:orgSlug/customers</code> will fail.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/adding-oauth-credentials.png" alt="Adding OAuth credentials to your app"></p>
<p class="caption">You will need to add your OAuth credentials to your web or mobile application</p>

<p>If you are creating a mobile application, you will need to include <strong>both</strong> the client ID and secret in your configuration file. If you are creating a web application, you <strong>only should include your client ID</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Specific implementation details for Android &amp; JS coming soon</em></p>
<h4 id="#3-create-a-customer" data-href="3-create-a-customer-8TVr">3. Create a customer<a href="#3-create-a-customer" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="3-create-a-customer-8TVr"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h4><p>You have now moved from the one-time configuration steps to a process that will occur for each new customer that uses your web or mobile app. As mentioned earlier in this section, much of what will be discussed in the next four steps will be magically handled by the Ruuvi SDKs, with no custom code needed from you. </p>
<p>After navigating to your application, one of the first things your customer will need to do is create an account. Because you are not running your own web server, the customer will be created in the Ruuvi system. They will provide a username and password in the form, that will serve as their login credentials to the app.</p>
<p>Specifically, the SDK will grab the customer's username and password, and hit the <code>POST /v1/orgs/:orgSlug/customers</code> API endpoint, passing along the customer's credentials <em>as well as</em> the OAuth client credentials you added to the config file in the previous step.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/create_customers.png" alt="creating a customer"></p>
<p class="caption">The create customer endpoint requires your OAuth client credentials,<br> and returns an access token for the newly created customer</p>

<p>For a mobile app, the SDK will require both the client ID and the secret to successfully authenticate. For a web app, the endpoint will only pass the client ID.</p>
<p>The <code>POST</code> customers endpoint both creates the customer as well as logs them in. As a result, an access token will be available to your application after successful customer creation. Remember that it is this access token that will allow the app to do things like claim the device, and interact with it.</p>
<p><em>Specific implementation details coming soon</em></p>
<h4 id="#4-create-claim-code-amp-send-to-device" data-href="4-create-claim-code-amp-send-to-device-e31c">4. Create Claim Code &amp; Send to Device<a href="#4-create-claim-code-amp-send-to-device" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="4-create-claim-code-amp-send-to-device-e31c"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h4><p>This step actually comprises a lot of things that happen behind the scenes, but has been combined for simplicity and ease of communication. A <strong>claim code</strong> is what is used to associate a device with a person. In your case, the claim code will associate a device with a customer.</p>
<p>In order for a device to be setup successfully, your application must retrieve a claim code on behalf of the customer setting up their device and send that claim code to the device. When the device receives proper Wi-Fi credentials and is able to connect to the Internet, it sends the claim code to the Ruuvi cloud. The Particle cloud then links the device to the customer, and grants the customer access over that device.</p>
<p>The first thing that must happen is retreiving a claim code from the Ruuvi cloud for the customer. A special endpoint exists for organizations to use to generate claim codes on behalf of their customers. </p>
<p>This endpoint is <code>POST /v1/orgs/:orgSlug/products/:productSlug/device_claims</code>. The customer's access token is required, and is used to generate a claim code that will allow for the link between the device and the customer.</p>
<p>Once your mobile/web app has a claim code, it then must then send it to the device.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/claim-code-setup.png" alt="Claim codes"></p>
<p class="caption">Your app will use the customer access token to generate a device claim code and send it to the device</p>

<p>This happens by connecting the customer's device to the <em>device's Wi-Fi access point</em>. When the ruuvitag is in <a href="/guide/getting-started/modes/ruuvitracker/#listening-mode">listening mode</a>, it is broadcasting a Wi-Fi network that the customer's computer or phone can connect to.</p>
<p>Once the customer's device is connected to the Ruuvi device's network, your mobile app then will send the claim code generated in the last step to the Particle device.</p>
<p>Again, this will all be part of the boilerplate code of the SDKs, meaning that you will not need to worry much about the nitty-gritty details about how this works.</p>
<p><em>Specific implementation details coming soon</em></p>
<h4 id="#5-connect-device-to-wi-fi" data-href="5-connect-device-to-wi-fi-6XyJ">5.

<p><img src="/assets/images/connect-to-wifi-setup.png" alt="Connect to Wi-Fi"></p>
<p class="caption">Your app will send the customer's device Wi-Fi credentials</p>

<p>Through your mobile or web app, your customer will choose from a list of available Wi-Fi networks, and provide a password (if necessary) to be able to connect.

<p class="caption">The device sends the claim code to the cloud, which is used to link the device to the customer</p>

<p>The device uses the Wi-Fi credentials to connect to the Internet, and immediately sends the claim code to the Ruuvi cloud. At that point, the device is considered "claimed" by the customer. This means that any access token generated by that customer can be used to read data from or interact with the device.</p>
<h4 id="#7-interact-with-customer-39-s-device" data-href="7-interact-with-customer-39-s-device-xVpL">7.

<p class="caption">Use your customer's access token to call functions, check variables, and more!</p>

<p>Your application, armed with the customer's access token, can now successfully authenticate with any device-specific Ruuvi API endpoint, giving it full access and control over the device. Some of the things you can do include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call functions on the device</li>
<li>Read variable values from the device</li>
<li>See if the device is online or not</li>
<li>Much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that now, your app will never communicate directly to the device. The customer will trigger a call to the Ruuvi API, which then communicates with the device to carry out the desired action.</p>

Your application would communicate with both your server as well as the Ruuvi cloud.</p>
<p>The most common reason to use two-legged authentication is the desire to store &amp; manage customer accounts yourself in your own database.</p>

With two-legged, you gain the ability to implement custom logic, integrations with third-party services, and store application-specific data that are not currently part of the Ruuvi platform. </p>
<p>For example, if you were building a connected hot tub, you could use your own web server and database to allow a customer to set their desired water temperature, then use that piece of data to set the temperature when the hot tub is turned on.</p>
<p>Another advantage of two-legged authentication is beefed-up security. Server-to-server communication (your server to the Ruuvi API) is much more secure than client-to-server communication (your mobile/web application to the Particle API). For sensitive transactions like passing OAuth credentials to get customer access tokens, using your server to talk to the Particle API over HTTPS is safe and protected.</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating new customers </li>

<p>Because the communication is server-to-server, you do not need to specify a scope. Without a scope, your client credentials can be successfully used for both of the purposes listed above.</p>
<p>In addition, no matter if you are building a web or mobile app, the <code>type</code> of client credentials you are generating will always be <code>installed</code> for two-legged authentication. This is because the credentials will be stored on your server.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/two-legged-add-oauth-creds.png" alt="Adding OAuth credentials to your server"></p>
<p class="caption">You must add your OAuth client credentials to your server</p>

<p>Because of the presence of your server, you should not need to add these credentials to your web or mobile application.</p>
<p><strong>Do not share your client ID and secret publically</strong>. These credentials provide the ability to fully control your product's devices, and access sensitive information about your organization. We recommend never publishing the client ID and secret to a GitHub repository. </p>

Create a customer<a href="#3-create-a-customer" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="3-create-a-customer-ERQN"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h4><p>When using two-legged authentication, you will likely be managing customers on your own database <em>(Note: We realize that you may not call end-users of your product "customers" like we do. You may simply refer to them as users internally. However, we will continue calling them customers here to avoid confusion)</em>.</p>
<p>An important thing to understand is that even though you will be creating customers yourself, you will also need to create a <em>shadow customer</em> on the Ruuvi cloud. That is, for every customer you create on your back-end, an mirroring customer record must be created using the Particle API. </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/create-customer-two-legged.png" alt="Creating a customer two-legged authorization"></p>
<p class="caption">You will create a Ruuvi <em>shadow customer</em> in addition to creating the customer on your own back-end.</p>

<p>A Ruuvi shadow customer is <strong>required</strong> to interact with Particle devices when using two-legged auth. Specifically, the customer must exist in the Particle system so that your server can generate <em>access tokens</em> on behalf of the customer. This allows your mobile or web application to interact with the customer's device.</p>
<p>The Ruuvi shadow customer should be created at the exact time that the customer is created in your system. As you will be managing customer credentials on your own server/database, a shadow customer <strong>should not have a password</strong> when they are created. You will still be able to generate access tokens for the customer using your OAuth client ID and secret instead of passing a username/password for that customer.</p>
<p>The API endpoint to create a customer is <code>POST /v1/orgs/:orgSlug/customers</code>. A request to create a customer could look something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl -X POST -u "client-id-goes-here:client-secret-goes-here" -d email=abu@agrabahmonkeys.com \
-d no_password=true https://api.ruuvi.io/v1/orgs/particle/customers
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there is no password for the customer. An email address is the only piece of information required to create a customer in the Ruuvi system, and <strong>must be collected by your application during signup</strong>. As a result,  you must pass the <code>no_password=true</code> flag to create the customer with no password. Note that in this endpoint, you should use your client ID and secret instead of an access token.</p>
<p>As the diagram above suggests, you will receive an access token in the response of the <code>POST</code> to creating of the customer. You will use this access token during the device claiming process as well as to interact with the device once it's set up.</p>
<p><a href="/reference/api/#create-a-customer">Reference docs on creating a customer</a></p>
<h4 id="#device-setup-steps-4-5-amp-6-" data-href="device-setup-steps-4-5-amp-6--jJs0">Device Setup (Steps 4, 5 &amp; 6)<a href="#device-setup-steps-4-5-amp-6-" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="device-setup-steps-4-5-amp-6--jJs0"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h4><p>Now that you have created the customer, and received a valid access token for that customer, it is now time to start the device setup process. This process will occur in exactly the same fashion as with Simple Authentication, and will not involve your server.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the device setup process will not involve your server. All communication will be between your web/mobile application, the customer's device, and the Ruuvi cloud. These steps will also be handled by the mobile &amp; JavaScript SDKs, involving extra work from you.</p>
<p>Because these steps are the same as for Simple Authentication, documentation will not be duplicated here. Instead, you can check out:</p>

Hooray! It's important to understand that while you do have your own server, <strong>we recommend hitting the Ruuvi API directly from your application client for any device-related actions</strong>. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling functions on the device</li>
<li>Reading variables on the device</li>
<li>Listing devices for a customer</li>
</ul>
<p>This should be straightforward, as using the SDKs will provide helper methods for these actions.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/two-legged-interact-with-device.png" alt="Interact with a device with two-legged auth"></p>
<p class="caption">For all direct interactions with the device, hit the Ruuvi API from your application client</p>

<p>The alternative would be telling your application client hit your back-end server, which would then trigger a call to the Ruuvi API. This introduces an extra intermediary in communication, and involves needing to unnecessarily "wrap" Particle API endpoints.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> reason for your server to hit the Ruuvi API is to generate new scoped access tokens for your customers. You should generate a fresh access token each time the customer logs into your application.</p>
<p>To do this, you will use the <code>POST /oauth/token</code> endpoint, but in a <a href="/reference/api/#generate-a-customer-scoped-access-token">special way</a>. The request will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl -u my-org-client-1234:long-secret -d grant_type=client_credentials \
-d scope=customer=jane@example.com https://api.ruuvi.io/oauth/token
</code></pre>
<p>Breaking this down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>-u</code> is a HTTP Basic Auth header, where you will pass your OAuth client ID and secret. This allows you to generate access tokens for customers that belong to your organization</li>
<li><code>grant_type</code> is the OAuth grant type, which in this case is <code>client_credentials</code></li>
<li><code>scope</code> is set to customer, and what allows you to specify the customer you'd like an access token for. The value of <code>customer</code> should be set to the <code>email</code> you passed when creating the customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The response should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">{
  "access_token": "254406f79c1999af65a7df4388971354f85cfee9",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 7776000,
  "refresh_token": "b5b901e8760164e134199bc2c3dd1d228acf2d90"
}
</code></pre>
<p>The response includes an <code>access_token</code> for the customer, that should be included for all subsequent API calls for the session. In addition, there's a <code>refresh_token</code> that you could use to generate a new access token in the event that the token expires. Here's how to use your refresh token to get a new access token:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">curl -X -POST -u client-id-1234:secret \
-d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token=b5b901e8760164e134199bc2c3dd1d228acf2d90 \
https://api.ruuvi.io/oauth/token
</code></pre>
<p>The response will be identical to the new access token creation endpoint above.</p>
