/*-------------

We've heavily commented this code for you. If you're a pro, feel free to ignore it.

Comments start with two slashes or are blocked off by a slash and a star.
You can read them, but your device can't.
It's like a secret message just for you.

Every program based on Wiring (programming language used by Arduino, and Ruuvi devices) has two essential parts:
setup - runs once at the beginning of your program
loop - runs continuously over and over

You'll see how we use these in a second. 

This program will blink an led on and off every second.
It blinks the D7 LED on your Ruuvi device. If you have an LED wired to D0, it will blink that LED as well.

-------------*/


// First, we're going to make some variables.
// This is our "shorthand" that we'll use throughout the program:

int led1 = D0; // Instead of writing D0 over and over again, we'll write led1
// You'll need to wire an LED to this one to see it blink.

int led2 = D7; // Instead of writing D7 over and over again, we'll write led2
// This one is the little blue LED on your board. On the RuuviTag it is next to D7, and on the RuuviTracker it is next to the USB jack.

// Having declared these variables, let's move on to the setup function.
// The setup function is a standard part of any microcontroller program.
// It runs only once when the device boots up or is reset.

void setup() {

  // We are going to tell our device that D0 and D7 (which we named led1 and led2 respectively) are going to be output
  // (That means that we will be sending voltage to them, rather than monitoring voltage that comes from them)

  // It's important you do this here, inside the setup() function rather than outside it or in the loop function.

  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);

}

// Next we have the loop function, the other essential part of a microcontroller program.
// This routine gets repeated over and over, as quickly as possible and as many times as possible, after the setup function is called.

We might have a security system that tells us, "motion was detected!" or a smart washing machine that tells us "your laundry is done!" In that case, we might want to use <code>Spark.publish</code>.</p>
<p><code>Spark.publish</code> sends a message to the cloud saying that some event has occured. We're allowed to name that event, set the privacy of that event, and add a little bit of info to go along with the event.</p>
<p>In this example, we've created a system where you turn your LED and photoresistor to face each other, making a beam of light that can be broken by the motion of your finger. Every time the beam is broken or reconnected, your device will send a <code>Spark.publish</code> to the cloud letting it know the state of the beam. Basically, a tripwire!</p>
<p>For your convenience, we've set up a little calibrate function so that your device will work no matter how bright your LED is, or how bright the ambient light may be. Put your finger in the beam when the D7 LED goes on, and hold it in the beam until you see two flashes from the D7 LED. Then take your finger out of the beam. If you mess up, don't worry-- you can just hit "reset" on your device and do it again!</p>
<p>You can check out the results on your dashboard at <a href="https://dashboard.particle.io">dashboard.ruuvi.io</a>. As you put your finger in front of the beam, you'll see an event appear that says the beam was broken. When you remove your finger, the event says that the beam is now intact.</p>

<p>Go find a buddy who has a RuuviTracker or RuuviTag. Your buddy does not have to be next to you-- he or she can be across the world if you like! All you need is Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Connect your device and copy the firmware on the right into a new app. Pick a weird name for your event. If your ruuvitracker were named <code>starfish</code> for example, you could make your event name something like <code>starfish_special_event_20150515</code>. Have your buddy pick a name for their event as well. No more than 63 ASCII characters, and no spaces!</p>
<p>Now replace <code>your_unique_event_name</code> with your actual event name and <code>buddy_unique_event_name</code> with your buddy's unique event name.</p>
<p>Have your buddy do the same thing, only with their event name and yours (swap 'em).</p>
<p>Flash the firmware to your devices. Calibrate your device when it comes online (same as in the previous example).</p>

<p>Ensure that the short end of the LED is plugged into <code>GND</code> and that the LED and Photoresistor are bent to face each other. (You want the LED, when turned on, to shine its beam of light directly at the photoresistor.) Try to leave enough space between the LED and the Photoresistor for your finger or a piece of paper.</p>

// Publish and Subscribe with Photoresistors
/* -----------------------------------------

Go find a buddy who also has a Spark device.
Each of you will pick a unique event name
   (make it weird so that no one else will have it)
   (no more that 63 ASCII characters, and no spaces)

In the following code, replace "your_unique_event_name" with your chosen name.
Replace "buddy_unique_event_name" with your buddy's chosen name.

Have your buddy do the same on his or her IDE.

Then, each of you should flash the code to your device.

Breaking the beam on one device will turn on the D7 LED on the second device.

Now you can send each other morse code messages!


But how does this magic work? Through the miracle of publish and subscribe.

We are going to Spark.publish a public event to the cloud.
That means that everyone can see you event and anyone can subscribe to it.
You and your buddy will both publish an event, and listen for each others events.

<h2 id="#tinker" data-href="tinker-uqvd">Tinker<a href="#tinker" class="header-permalinks" data-menu-href="tinker-uqvd"><i class="ion-link"></i></a></h2><p>Remember back when we were blinking lights and reading sensors with Tinker on the mobile app?</p>
<p>When you tap a pin on the mobile app, it sends a message up to the cloud. Your device is always listening to the cloud and waiting for instructions-- like "write D7 HIGH" or "read the voltage at A0".</p>
<p>Your device already knew how to communicate with the mobile app because of the firmware loaded onto your device as a default. We call this the Tinker firmware. It's just like the user firmware you've been loading onto your device in these examples. It's just that with the Tinker firmware, we've specified special <code>Spark.function</code>s that the mobile app knows and understands.</p>
<p>If your device is new, it already has the Tinker firmware on it. It's the default firmware stored on your device right from the factory. When you put your own user firmware on your device, you'll rewrite the Tinker firmware. (That means that your device will no longer understand commands from the Ruuvi mobile app.) However, you can always get the Tinker firmware back on your device by putting it in <a href="/ruuvitag/modes/#selecting-various-modes-factory-reset">factory reset mode</a>, or by re-flashing your device with Tinker in the Particle app.</p>
<p>To reflash Tinker from within the app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS Users</strong>: Tap the list button at the top left. Then tap the arrow next to your desired device and tap the "Re-flash Tinker" button in the pop out menu.</li>
<li><strong>Android Users</strong>: With your desired device selected, tap the options button in the upper right and tap the "Reflash Tinker" option in the drop down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tinker app is a great example of how to build a very powerful application with not all that much code. If you're a technical person, you can have a look at the latest release <a href="https://github.com/spark/firmware/blob/master/src/application.cpp">here.</a></p>
<p>I know what you're thinking: this is amazing, but I really want to use Tinker <em>while</em> my code is running so I can see what's happening! Now you can.</p>
<p>Combine your code with this framework, flash it to your device, and Tinker away. You can also access Tinker code by clicking on the last example in the online IDE's code menu.</p>
