# Hack

### Code your own firmware
RuuviTag firmware project can be used as a template for your own program. Everything is on [GitHub](http://github.com/ruuvi/ruuvitag_fw).

A great place to find help and reference code projects is Nordic Semiconductor's [GitHub organization](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor). You should also check their [DevZone](devzone.nordicsemi.com). And remember to join our [Slack team](http://ruuvi.com/blog/ruuvi-slack-com.html).

### Create mobile application
The most common use case for beacons is to read data they're broadcasting using a mobile phone. There are many open-source projects you can use as a starting point.
