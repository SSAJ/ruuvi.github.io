# Programming

### Code your own firmware
RuuviTag firmware projects can be used as a template for your own program. Everything is on [GitHub](http://github.com/ruuvi/ruuvitag_fw).

A great place to find help and reference code projects is Nordic Semiconductor's [GitHub organization](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor). You should also check their [DevZone](devzone.nordicsemi.com). And remember to join our [Slack team](http://ruuvi.slack.com) by [requesting](mailto:slack@ruuvi.com) an invite.

### Create a mobile application
The most common use case for beacons is to read data they're broadcasting using a mobile phone. You can find many ready-made application with beacon functionality from Google Play / App Store. There are also several open-source projects you can use as a starting point if you would like to create your own.
