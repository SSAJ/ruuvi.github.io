# Ruuvi Documentation
This guide will help you with your brand new RuuviTag device.

The guide is partly under construction and we'll add more content in the {{{popup 'coming months' 'note' 'Thanks for your patience, friend.'}}}.

Getting Started helps you to setup your device:
- [_Getting Started_](/guide/getting-started/start)

And if you are looking for more info about how to customize our designs:
- [_How to create a product of your own_](/guide/how-to-build-a-product) (business customers)

To join Ruuvi Community, [message us](mailto:slack@ruuvi.com) to request an invite to [Ruuvi Slack Team](http://ruuvi.com/blog/ruuvi-slack-com.html). All of our development discussion takes place on Slack and we would be happy if you would like to join us.
