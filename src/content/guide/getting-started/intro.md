This guide will show you how to use Ruuvi to make a connected device, from the first time you connect to the cloud to the day you manufacture and ship your connected product.

The guide is broken down into three parts:
- **Getting Started** goes over how to connect your device and then dives into some examples to get you used to the connected platform. If you've never played with connected hardware before, Getting Started is the section for you! It's filled with small {{{ popup 'footnotes' 'note' 'When you hover over or click these, you will get more info on the underlined word.'}}} that you can hover over or (on smaller screens and mobile) click or tap for more info. If you're an expert, you may want to take the first few chapters to connect your device, then move on Tools and Features.
- **Tools and Features** details the different parts of the Ruuvi platform that come in handy as you build a connected product. It includes using Particle Dev, the Dashboard, the Command Line Interface (CLI) and more.
- **How to Build a Product** is the final section. It reviews everything you need to do to take the connected device you've prototyped and take it to production.

We'll fill in more parts of the guide in the {{{popup 'coming months' 'note' 'Thanks for your patience, friend.'}}}, but for now the best way to use the guide is:
- Go through _Getting Started_
- Review _Tools and Features_
- Search _[the community](http://community.ruuvi.io)_ for cool examples and advice relevant to your exact project
- Check out _How to Build a Product_ for final advice
