This guide will help you with the Ruuvi devices.

[POWER ON MY RUUVITAG >](/guide/getting-started/start)

This guide is partly under construction and we'll add more info in the {{{popup 'coming months' 'note' 'Thanks for your patience, friend.'}}}, but for now the best way to use the guide is:
- Go through [_Getting Started_](/guide/getting-started)
- Check out [_How to Build a Product_](/guide/how-to-build-a-product)
- Message [Lauri](mailto:lauri@ruuvi.com) to request an invite to [Ruuvi Slack team](http://ruuvi.com/blog/ruuvi-slack-com.html). All of our development discussion takes place on Slack.
