# RuuviTag Documentation
This guide will help you with your brand new Ruuvi device.

The guide is partly under construction and we'll add more content in the {{{popup 'coming months' 'note' 'Thanks for your patience.'}}}.

Getting Started helps you to setup your device:
- [_Getting Started_](/guide/getting-started/start)

Detailed info about the hardware:
- [_Specifications of the HW_](/specs/ruuvitag-b2)

And if you are looking for more info about how to customize our designs:
- [_How to create a product of your own_](/guide/how-to-build-a-product) (business customers)
