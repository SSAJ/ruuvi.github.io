# Introduction to THE GUIDE
{{#if ruuvitag}}
This guide will help you with the Ruuvi devices.

[POWER ON MY RUUVITAG >](/guide/getting-started/start/ruuvitag)

This guide is partly under construction and we'll add more info in the {{{popup 'coming months' 'note' 'Thanks for your patience, friend.'}}}, but for now the best way to use the guide is:
- Go through _Getting Started_
- Check out _How to Build a Product_
- Email [Lauri](mailto:lauri@ruuvi.com) to request an invite to [Ruuvi Slack team](http://ruuvi.com/blog/ruuvi-slack-com.html). All of our development discussion takes place over there.

Click the arrow to the right of the screen to read on.

Unfortunately RuuviTracker's documentation isn't ready. We're working on it and it'll be live {{{popup 'later' 'note' 'Thanks for your patience, friend.'}}}. In the meantime, you can read about <a href="/guide/getting-started/intro/ruuvitag"><li class="device" id="ruuvitag">RuuviTag</li></a>.
