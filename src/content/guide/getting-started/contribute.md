# How to contribute to Ruuvi's projects?

Ruuvi products and projects are 100% open-source. You might find something you'd like changed, a feature you'd like implemented, or a bug you see a fix for. If so, you can create a pull request or an issue on one of our open-source GitHub repos. Travel to [GitHub](https://github.com/ruuvi) to see what we have!

## Ruuvi Community

If you would like to join the Ruuvi Community, send an informal email to [Lauri](mailto:lauri@ruuvi.com) to request an invite to our [Slack team](http://ruuvi.com/blog/ruuvi-slack-com.html). All the development discussion is over there.

## Using GitHub

Go [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to get a sense of Github flow. We also suggest the [Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application, which has a great built-in tutorial on forking, editing, merging, and creating a pull request.

If you prefer the command line, here's an [extra fast tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) on how to get started. Just make sure you [fork a repo to your Github account](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) before cloning your fork to edit on your local machine.
