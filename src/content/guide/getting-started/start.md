## How to use your RuuviTag?

In this example, we will start the device for the first time and upload a demo application into its memory.


### Step 1: Power On Your Device
Insert a battery (CR2450 or CR2477) so that metallic battery connnector touches GND pad of the battery. Now the device is in operational mode and pre-installed bootloader software is running. One of the LEDs should be lit (on, not blinking).

### Step 2: Upload application

Open the mobile app on your phone and upload the firmware by pressing DFU icon.

### Step 3: It's alive!

After Over-the-Air DFU is completed, RuuviTag starts to run the application code. Success!
