# How to create a product of your own?

Our primary goal at Ruuvi is to have fun by designing cool open sourced products.

In addition to hobbyists, also product creators (engineers and entrepreneurs) can use Ruuvi products to prototype their ideas and products. If Ruuvi products aren't exactly what you're looking for, they can be easily customized to meet your requirements. 

### Great, but what if we need help or we cannot use the Creative COmmons license?

Building a hardware product is a complicated process and requires knowlegde on many areas. To design and produce a circuit board, you need to complete these steps:

- Requirement specifications
- Technical specifications
- Component selection
- Schematics
- Footprints
- PCB design
- PCB manufacturing
- Stencil manufacturing
- Component sourcing
- PCB assembly
- Quality control & testing
- Packaging

...and that's not all. Usually you'll need to pay attention to these:

- Mechanical engineering (enclosure)
- CE/FCC/Bluetooth approvals
- Firmware development
- Web development
- Mobile app development
- Logistics

If you don't have required expertise to handle these by yourself, [email us](mailto:info@ruuvi.com). We want to help. If we design something for you, there won't be any license restrictions. It will be a product of your own.
